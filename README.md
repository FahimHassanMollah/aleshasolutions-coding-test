# About Project

This Project is build as an assignment of Alesha Solutions Ltd. for Laravel Developer.

I build this project with Laravel and Vue. 

##Project Initialization Step:

1. Clone git this repository `git clone https://mrbd1012@bitbucket.org/mrbd1012/aleshasolutions-coding-test.git`
2. Run command `composer install`
3. Run command `npm install & npm run dev`
4. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`
5. Connect to sql database. 
6. Run command `php artisan migrate --seed` for run migrations & seed files.
7. Run command `php artisan serve` to run development server. 

I am trying to focus on clean and structural code with service pattern at backend.
